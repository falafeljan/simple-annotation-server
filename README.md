# Simple Annotation Server

This is a very simple annotation server for intended testing purposes, implementing both the [Web Annotation Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/) as well as the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/). The server is written in JavaScript and runs in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), running an in-process LevelDB database.
